    <long-description>
      The Beagle Pup is a low-wing, light sport and general aviation aircraft
      designed and built during the 1960s by Beagle Aircraft Ltd at Shoreham and
      Rearsby in the United Kingdom. Three variants were built: the Pup 100, Pup
      150 and Pup 160, all of which share the same airframe and cockpit. The
      numeric suffix indicates rated horsepower.
